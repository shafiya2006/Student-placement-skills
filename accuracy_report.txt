8. “Show all students with CGPA above 8.0.”

Answer:

ID 67 with CGPA 3.29

ID 89 with CGPA 3.84

 Incorrect — CGPA above 8.0 is extremely high on a 4-point scale.
 Returned students with CGPA below 4.0, meaning the model misunderstood.

Rating: 2/10

9. “Does any student have experience above 2 years?”

Answer:

Student ID 90 → 27 years

Student ID 419 → 27 years

 Possible error — 27 years experience is unrealistic for students
 Could be incorrect extraction or hallucination
 Answer should match raw dataset

Rating: 5/10

⭐ Overall Final Accuracy Score

If we average the ratings:

(9 + 9 + 10 + 8 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 2 + 5) / 9 = 8.1 / 10

🎯 Final Accuracy Rating: 8/10

Your system is performing good, but:

It struggles when numerical thresholds are unusual (CGPA > 8.0)

It may hallucinate unrealistic values (experience = 27 years)
